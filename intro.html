            <h3>What is COVID-19?</h3><br>
            <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.</p>
            <p>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
                recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems
                like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to
                develop serious illness.</p>
            <p>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the
                disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands
                or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an
                infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for
                example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>
